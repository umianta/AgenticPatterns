# Prompt Chaining Pattern Example

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the **Prompt Chaining** patternâ€”breaking down complex tasks into sequential, composable prompts to enhance control, clarity, and reliability.

## ðŸ“– Introduction

**Prompt Chaining** is a core design pattern in LLM development.  
Instead of asking the model to solve everything in a single prompt, the task is decomposed into smaller subtasks. Each stepâ€™s output becomes the input to the next, resulting in more reliable and interpretable results.  

Benefits include:
- Easier debugging and modularity  
- Greater transparency and validation at intermediate steps  
- Flexibility to reroute or branch workflows

## ðŸ“‚ Notebook Contents

- **Step 1:** Define the overall task (e.g., summarization â†’ translation)  
- **Step 2:** Create prompt templates for each stage  
- **Step 3:** Implement chaining logic (step-by-step execution)  
- **Step 4:** Add validation or checks between steps  
- **Step 5:** (Optional) Error handling and branching logic  
- **Step 6:** Review the final combined result
